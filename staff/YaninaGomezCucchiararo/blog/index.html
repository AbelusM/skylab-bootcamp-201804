                <h1>LASAÑA DE TOFU CREAM Y CALABACÍN</h1>
                <p>At home you can never eat pasta, I do not know what it is but it is always well received by our palates and
                    stomachs hehehe ... So let's try new things experimenting with what there is at home and in an improvisation
                    morning, this delicious lasagna of tofu-crema with zucchini and tomato emerged. He baptized the title
                    with the term tofu-crema because I am very imaginative when I want, jurjur ... No, he called it that
                    because he passed it through the raw processor and he got an unctuous consistency pâté type that has
                    been super good to bind all the vegetable sauce.

                <h1>MUFFINS</h1>
                <p>
                    As you know, I'm pretty addicted to homemade muffins. I'm experimenting with different ingredients and I've discovered that
                    vegan variations are my favorite, the ones that feel better and the ones that they are simpler to elaborate.
                    Today I bring you a delicious proposal with lemon cream style 'Lemon curd' that we are going to use as
                    a filling / cover, to give our muffins a citrus flavor addictive, I promise that it gives an acid touch
                    that goes to them of pearls.
