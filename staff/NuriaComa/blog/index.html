                <h3>MY TRIP TO NY</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>I recently went on a trip to New York in October with my boyfriend and it was beautiful. I wanted to share my trip with you guys, what I did and what I ate, in case you are planning on taking a trip to New York anytime soon. Understand though that this isn’t a ‘guide’ by any means, and doesn’t include all the best restaurants ever in New York. This is just my little trip, where I ate very well and had a good time.</p>

                <h3>MY TRIP TO MARRAKECH</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>After a very swift 3 hour flight with British Airways from Gatwick, I arrived into the fabulous Beachcomber Royal Palm Hotel at dusk with a lovely greeting from the well presented staff.After lunch it was time to head into the Red City of Marrakech! I have never been to Marrakech and knew very little about it. As we drove further and further into the city it was apparent at how crazy, hectic and buzzing this spectacular place was. Steeped in history, our first stop was the Bahia Palace which is a 19th-century Palace that still functions as a royal residence where the king entertains, but dozens of rooms are open to the public to see how the royals lived.Our second stop was a visit to the Souks and thank goodness we had a guide for our limited time because it would have taken me a day to find my way out through the labyrinth of these chaotic streets! If anywhere is appropriate to wear my ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’ t-shirt it’s here. These souks are like nothing I have ever seen before, an array of spectacular colours, vibrant and a certain energy that hits you as soon as you step foot inside this crazy maze. There isn’t anything you can’t buy from here, spices, bags and lanterns to baskets, shoes, carpets and scarfs galore. After dodging numerous motorcycles, carts and donkeys, we visited an apothecary which was very interesting and gave a great insight into how the natural products of Morocco are used in medicine and of course stocked up on the very popular Moroccan Argan Oil. Next we entered the workers part of the souk where we watched the local carpenters and blacksmiths crafting their products in the smallest of places to stock up the shelves of the souks shops. Even if you are not into shopping, you need to experience the all kinds of crazy Marrakech souks have to offer.</p>
